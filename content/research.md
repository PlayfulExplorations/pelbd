# Active Grants

## I-TEST

This project is an NSF funded grant which aims to contribute to the knowledge base about strategies and models that enhance girls’ interest in and capabilities to pursue CS programs and occupations. In particular, we research the effects of single versus balanced gender CS camps and role models on middle school children’s interest, self-efficacy and skill development.

## CWG

This project was funded by the Center for Women and Gender at USU. It aims to investigate retention of women in CS majors from the perspective of those women who persist in the major.
